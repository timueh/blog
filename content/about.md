# tl; dr

Hi, I am Tillmann, and I am in my mid-thirties.
I live a happy life in the middle of Germany.
Most likely, you'll find me reading a book, riding my bike, fancying music (drums, piano, choir), hanging out with lovely people (which applies to my kids in the usual 80-fashion), cooking, or so.
If not, then I'm probably working.

Or writing content for this site, maybe.

In case you wondered: I am a big fan of tables and short paragraphs.
In fact, if I can't convey an idea (or a problem) in about three sentences, then I tend to question my own conviction of having a clear idea about the very idea  (or having understood the problem for that matter).

But I digress.

# Background

I work as a Senior IT guy at Deutsche Bahn.
My fields of expertise vary, ranging from programming, software engineering, and cloud engineering to DevOps, GenAI, software architecture, and agility.

I feel comfortable in many positions, be it debugging and staring at logs in a terminal, or be it arranging for a nice management-level presentation.

My motivation originates at the intersection of intellectual curiosity and being able to advance the common good.
This explains why I feel comfortable on many different (professional) levels.

Arguably, I am no singleton.
I can thrive only with (and because of) others.
Hence, I am intrigued by curious minds surrounding me.

# Bio

I've spent about eleven years in Academia, first studying cybernetics, then pursuing a PhD in uncertainty quantification for power systems optimization.
My academic route was a very scenic one:

| Where? |  When? | 
| ---  | --- |
| Otto-von-Guericke-University |  2009 - 2015 |
| The University of Melbourne  | 2012 - 2013 |
| Massachusetts Institute of Technology  | 2014 - 2015 |
| Karlsruhe Institute of Technology  | 2015 - 2020 |
| Los Alamos National Laboratory |  2017 |
| EPFL (École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne)  | 2018 |
| DB (Deutsche Bahn) | Since 2021

It's fair to say that I've begun as a chemical engineer, morphed into an applied mathematician, had to become an electrical engineer, just to find pleasure in the field of software engineering.
