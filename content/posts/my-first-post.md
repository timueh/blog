Hi there, this is my first post.
Hence, it comes with the usual clumsy attitude of _firsts_: you don't really know how to behave accordingly.

So I'll jump into specificity, and provide the event for creating this site: the event triggering this site is that my son has grown fond of chess.

Okay?

And that, in turn, intrigued me to do some research about the rabbit hole that calls itself _chess programming_.
I thought, why not start some little side project that deploys some chess-related application on a `k8s` cluster, or so.

So, here is this site.

I may have missed the initial target (namely chess-relatedness), but that just leaves me with room for future improvement.

Stay tuned.
